"Open Bookmark folders" chrome extension 
==========================================

What is it?
-----------

This extension lets you open all links in a bookmark folder by typing "ob <foldername>" into the address bar (Chromes "omnibox"). Download from the [chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-bookmark-folder/clapomiagkdmpgjclehajclninkdnihd)

It is a replacement for Operas folder nicknames.

To change the identifier ("ob" per default), go to the option page and follow the instructions (or see this [stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/a/18219395/1380673))
